                But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, A avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it pain, because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some.
